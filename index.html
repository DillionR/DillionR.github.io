               <h3>I hope to do a 4-year undergraduate in computer engineering at the University of Utah and then attend medical 
school at either MIT or Stanford, with the intent to become a neural surgeon. It shall be a lot of schooling, 
8+ years at medical school, but I figure that it is better to be doing something than to let life become stagnant.
 Going into the medical field will give me a chance to help people and give back to society. After everything that
 people have done me, I figure it is the least I can do. </h3>
