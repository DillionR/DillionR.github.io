        <h3>My name is Dillion Rieben, if it wasn't obvious. I am 16 years old and currently attending Taylorsville High and will be a junior this coming school year.
I have played soccer and basketball on and off for 8 years. I have been interested in coding since 7th grade and started to persue it more heavily in 8th grade when me and a few friends made our science fair project in MS-DOS.
This course by far is the most intensive I have studied coding.
I hope to graduate highschool and then attend college and obtain a 4 year under graduate in Computer Science. From there I want to attend Medical School with the hopes of one day becoming a surgeon.</h3>
